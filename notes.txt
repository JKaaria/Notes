# User Guide for Data Management and Email Notification

## Introduction

This user guide provides instructions on how to use the Data Management and Email Notification script. The script is designed to perform various data management operations on a workbook, including data extraction, filtering, formula application, and email notification.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following:

- Microsoft Excel installed on your machine.
- A workbook with data saved in the relevant sheets (e.g., "Delphi," "EISS," "Formula," "FISS," "LogicTable").
- Specific sheets named according to the script requirements.

## Script Overview

The script consists of five main subroutines and a supporting function:

1. **Sub One**
   - Copies data from a source workbook (matching a specified pattern) to the "Delphi" sheet in the active workbook.

2. **Sub Two**
   - Copies data from a source workbook (matching a specified pattern) to the "EISS" sheet in the active workbook.

3. **Sub Three**
   - Applies specific formulas to columns A and B in the "Delphi" sheet based on predefined formulas in the "Formula" sheet.

4. **Sub Four**
   - Deletes columns A to J in the "FISS" sheet.

5. **Sub EmailWithTableAndHeaders**
   - Sends an email notification with a specific table range and headers based on selected columns from the active sheet.

6. **Function RangetoHTML**
   - A supporting function that converts a range to HTML format for inclusion in the email body.

## Running the Script

1. **Open Workbook:**
   - Open the workbook containing the data and the script.

2. **Enable Macros:**
   - Ensure that macros are enabled in Excel.

3. **Run Sub One to Sub EmailWithTableAndHeaders:**
   - Press `Alt + F8`, select the desired subroutine, and click `Run` to execute the specific operation.

## Important Notes

- **Sheet Names:**
  - If your sheets have different names, adjust the sheet names in the script accordingly.

- **Source File Patterns:**
  - In Sub One and Sub Two, the source files are selected based on patterns. Adjust the `sourceFileName` patterns as needed.

- **Formula Application:**
  - In Sub Three, formulas are applied to columns A and B in the "Delphi" sheet based on predefined formulas in the "Formula" sheet.

- **Column Deletion:**
  - In Sub Four, columns A to J are deleted in the "FISS" sheet.

- **Email Composition:**
  - In Sub EmailWithTableAndHeaders, an email is composed with a specific table range and headers. The recipient email address and subject are dynamically set based on data in the active sheet.
