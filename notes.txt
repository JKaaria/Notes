Subject: Medical Leave and Grievance Discussions

Dear ,

I hope this email finds you both well. I am writing to inform you of my decision to request medical leave effective immediately whilst I close any ongoing discussions regarding the grievances I had previously raised with HR.

Due to personal circumstances and health concerns, I am not in the right condition to continue working or to see out my notice period. As such, I will be obtaining a doctor's note starting from Monday to support my request for medical leave.

Furthermore, I would like to inform you that I am closing discussions with HR regarding the open grievance. While I appreciate the efforts made to address the issues, I believe it is in my best interest to prioritize my health and well-being at this time.

I trust you will understand my decision and appreciate your cooperation in processing my request for medical leave.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Jeremy Kaaria
