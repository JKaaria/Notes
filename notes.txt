Subject: Reevaluating Long-Term Unmatched Trades Protocol and Enhancing Cross-Functional Understanding

Dear Bill,

I trust this message finds you well. I'd like to discuss our current approach to long-term unmatched trades and underscore a few key points:

- **Electronic Trading Platforms:** A significant portion of these trades is executed directly by clients on electronic platforms, ensuring immediate recognition.

- **Duplicate Bookings:** Our EFI team actively monitors platforms like Tradeweb, minimizing the risk of oversight even in the case of duplicates.

- **CTM Confirmation/Affirmation:** The CTM confirmation process provides a robust layer of validation, ensuring the legitimacy of transactions.

- **Hedge Values and Basis Risk:** It's important to note that trades are effectively hedged, and any remaining risk is primarily basis-related. Traders should be monitoring basis risk daily to mitigate potential discrepancies.

From the macro trading floor perspective, both Osama and Magda share the same view as me. There seems to be a disconnect between the Middle Office (MO) and Front Office (FO) priorities. It might be beneficial for us to initiate knowledge-sharing sessions to bridge this gap and gain a deeper understanding of the true risks involved.

I propose a brief meeting to discuss this holistic approach, ensuring that our efforts align seamlessly with the broader goals of the Front Office.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

[Your Name] Business Analyst, FICC Middle Office
