Subject: Request for Extract: Nexus Migration Status for Clean-Up Initiative

Dear [Brexit Reconciliations Team],

I trust this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am a Business Analyst from the Barclays Macro Fixed Income Middle Office, focusing on the credit side of our operations. I hope this message serves as an introduction to a collaboration that could significantly contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of our processes.

We recently completed a successful UST Entity Reconciliation project, which has prompted interest in implementing a similar initiative on the credit side. As part of this effort, we are looking to conduct a clean-up of our datasets, specifically focusing on the nexus migration status of a pre-defined list of clients in the USD Corp bond space.

The objective of this clean-up is to confirm clients' migration status, identify any dual entitlements, and ensure accurate and up-to-date entity entitlements in our onboarding system. Given your team's expertise in handling Brexit-related trade booking entity exceptions on the BBI flow, we believe that your insights and data would be invaluable for this initiative.

Here are the key components we are looking to address in the clean-up:

1. Confirm Clients' Migration Status: Provide an extract detailing the nexus migration status (migrated, not migrated, dual entitled) for the pre-defined list of clients.

2. Trading History for Active Clients: Pull trading history data for our most active clients in the USD Corp bond space to assist in validating their entity entitlements.

3. Entity Entitlements in Onboarding System: Validate and update the entity entitlements in our onboarding system based on the extracted information.

We understand the sensitivity and confidentiality of this information, and we assure you that it will be handled with the utmost care and only used for the purposes outlined in this initiative.

If your team is able to provide the requested extract or if there are any additional steps or considerations necessary for us to proceed, please let us know. We greatly appreciate your support in this endeavor and look forward to the potential collaboration.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name]
