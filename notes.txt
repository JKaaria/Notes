As a business analyst, you analyzed data related to trade fails from a cloud-based reporting system in a global investment bank.
Your analysis revealed that the manual process of assigning ownership of items between operational departments has resulted in poor quality categorization of ownership.
Of 412 items, only 311 are currently accurately categorized, and 42 have been completely resolved, leaving 59 items with incorrect categorization.
This inaccurate categorization can lead to misinformed decisions based on inaccurate reporting and skews management reporting views.
To improve the categorization of ownership, the investment bank can consider implementing an automated system or standardized process that ensures accuracy and consistency in assigning ownership of items.
Addressing this issue is crucial to avoid further misinformed decisions and improve the overall efficiency of the trade fails reporting system.
