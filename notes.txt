Subject: Formal Complaint: Mid-Level-Management

Dear Andrew,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my grievances surrounding my resignation from Barclays. The following issues have unfortunately made it untenable for me to continue in my role:

1. Misrepresentation of Work Arrangement: Initially, I was offered a position at Barclays under the understanding of a one-day-per-week office policy, which was later increased to two days. This change was not communicated transparently, leading to a misalignment of expectations prior to joining the bank.

2. Unfair Treatment in Workspace Allocation: Despite expressing my concerns, I was singled out within a larger team, being the sole individual forced to sit on the trading floor without mobile data access. This lack of consideration for my preferences compromised the safety/wellbeing of my family and contributed to mental health complications.

3. Family Accessibility Concerns: As the sole driving license holder in my household, responsible for a child with autism requiring heightened attention, the inability to contact my family during working hours for two days a week over a prolonged period significantly exacerbated stress and concern. This lack of access could have potentially jeopardised my family's well-being in the event of an emergency.

Forced Promotion: Despite vocalising my reservations about accepting a promotion due to the resulting impact on my work-life balance, I was again forced to take on additional responsibilities against my wishes. This decision disregarded my personal circumstances and preferences.

5. Net Pay Cut Amidst Financial Crisis: The imposition of a net pay cut amidst the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, meaning an increased workload expectation at no added benefit; further exacerbated financial strain and contributed to the deterioration of my mental well-being.

6. Resignation Due to Mental Health Concerns: Regrettably, the cumulative effect of these unresolved grievances, coupled with the resultant financial distress and imbalance between work and personal life, has compelled me to resign from my position at Barclays. My mental health has been significantly impacted, necessitating this difficult decision for my well-being and stability.

I want to emphasise that I have also formally raised these concerns with HR to ensure they are documented and addressed appropriately. It is my sincere hope that Barclays takes steps to rectify these issues to create a more equitable and supportive work environment for all employees.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I would appreciate your acknowledgment of receipt of this complaint and resignation.

Sincerely,

Jeremy Kaaria

Despite my attempts to resolve these issues internally, they remain unaddressed, necessitating my decision to escalate them to HR for further action.

1. Misrepresentation of Work Arrangement: I was initially offered a role under a one-day-per-week office policy, which was subsequently increased to two days without transparent communication.
2. Unfair Treatment in Workspace Allocation: Despite expressing concerns, I was singled out to sit on the trading floor without mobile data access, compromising my productivity and comfort.
3. Family Accessibility Concerns: As the sole driving license holder in my household, the inability to contact my family during working hours for two days a week over a prolonged period significantly impacted my family's well-being.
4. Forced Promotion: Despite expressing reservations, I was compelled to accept a promotion, further straining my work-life balance.
5. Net Pay Cut Amidst Financial Crisis: The imposition of a pay cut amidst the ongoing cost-of-living crisis exacerbated financial strain.
6. Resignation Due to Mental Health Concerns: Regrettably, the cumulative effect of these grievances has led to my resignation due to mental health concerns.

I kindly request that HR conducts a thorough investigation into these matters and takes appropriate steps to address them to ensure a fair and supportive work environment for all employees.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am available to provide any further information or clarification if required.

Sincerely,
