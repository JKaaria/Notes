# User Guide for Workbook Operations and Email Notification

## Introduction

This user guide provides instructions on how to use the Workbook Operations and Email Notification script. The script is designed to perform various operations on a workbook, including data extraction, filtering, and emailing a specific table range.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following:

- Microsoft Excel installed on your machine.
- A workbook with data saved in the sheet named "TradeData" (or the actual name of your data sheet).
- Specific sheets named "TradeData" and "LogicTable" for certain operations.

## Script Overview

The script consists of four main subroutines and a supporting function:

1. **Sub One**
   - Copies data from a source workbook (matching a specified pattern) to the "TradeData" sheet in the active workbook.

2. **Sub Two**
   - Deletes rows from the "TradeData" sheet where the value in column AW does not start with "US912."

3. **Sub Three**
   - Filters and cleans the "TradeData" sheet based on specific criteria, including keeping rows with specific names and deleting unnecessary columns.

4. **Sub Four**
   - Sends an email notification with an attached workbook to a specified recipient, including a specific table range.

5. **Function RangetoHTML**
   - A supporting function that converts a range to HTML format for inclusion in the email body.

## Running the Script

1. **Open Workbook:**
   - Open the workbook containing the data and the script.

2. **Enable Macros:**
   - Ensure that macros are enabled in Excel.

3. **Run Sub One to Sub Four:**
   - Press `Alt + F8`, select the desired subroutine (One to Four), and click `Run` to execute the specific operation.

## Important Notes

- **Sheet Names:**
  - If your sheets have different names, adjust the sheet names in the script accordingly.

- **Source File Pattern:**
  - In Sub One, the source file is selected based on a pattern. Adjust the `sourceFileName` pattern as needed.

- **Recipient Email:**
  - In Sub Four, replace the email address in the `.To` property with the actual recipient email address.

- **Outlook Access:**
  - Ensure you have access to Microsoft Outlook for sending emails.

- **Modify Email Subject:**
  - You can modify the subject of the email in Sub Four if needed.
