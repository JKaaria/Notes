Hi [RM Contact's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding a matter that has surfaced in our recent analysis of settlement processes in the EUR SSA market. Specifically, we have observed a trend of trades being sent to the market before the value date, receiving swift settlement acknowledgments ('ACK'), but experiencing delays in settling cash/securities between VD+1 and VD+3.

Upon further investigation, we noticed that these acknowledged trades are not returning any market reference, raising concerns about the efficiency and transparency of the settlement process.

To gain a better understanding and address this issue, I would greatly appreciate your insights on the following:

1. Could you provide any context or information regarding the absence of market references in the acknowledgment process?
2. Are there any recent changes or updates on Euroclear's end that might be contributing to this phenomenon?
3. What steps, if any, can we take collaboratively to streamline and expedite the settlement process for these acknowledged trades?

Your expertise and assistance in shedding light on this matter would be invaluable as we work towards enhancing our settlement efficiency.

Thank you in advance for your time and attention to this inquiry. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
