Subject: Follow-Up: Request for Database Access for GMO Risk Dashboard Integration

Hi Lucy and Nikhil,

I hope this email finds you well.

Following our recent discussions about the rates allocations blotter enhancement for back-office detail, I wanted to bring to your attention the priority shift regarding our data requirements.

As we continue to address outstanding requests with SWS technology teams, it's imperative that we streamline our approach to meet critical risk and control enhancements ahead of markets transitioning to T+1 settlement.

Given the challenges faced with obtaining automated extracts and scheduling them on an hourly frequency intraday, I propose exploring alternative solutions to ensure timely and efficient access to essential data.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss the feasibility and steps required to proceed with granting database access to SWS/CATS/TCW via our data platform, Altery? This approach not only addresses our current requirements but also aligns with our broader objective of enhancing risk management capabilities.

Looking forward to your insights and guidance on this matter.

Best Regards,
Jeremy Kaaria
