Subject: Response: Settlement Rate and Average Trade Notional for SSA EUR Trading Pod

Hi Paul,

I hope you're doing well. Thank you for your prompt response and the additional inquiries. Here are the figures you requested regarding the SSA EUR trading pod:

1. **Settlement Rate:**
   - Over the past 5 days, we observed an average of approximately 34 failed settlements out of 373 trades, resulting in a settlement failure rate of around 9% for the week.
   - On a daily basis, the average number of fails is approximately 30 out of 1500 trades, accounting for approximately 2% of the daily total fail volume for fixed income.

2. **Average Trade Notional:**
   - The average trade notional for the desk over the same period is $3,716,946.49.

3. **Average Failed Trade Notional:**
   - The average notional for failed trades during this period is $3,039,415.4.

I've also attached the communication chain with our settlement partners regarding the 'acknowledge' delays at the market level. This should provide additional context and insights into our ongoing efforts to address the issues.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like to delve deeper into or if you have any further questions. I'm here to assist in any way I can.
