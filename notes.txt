
Certainly! Given that the clean-up initiative involves addressing BBI-related booking issues within the broader project, here's an integrated approach:

1. **Data Analysis and Segmentation:**
   - **Objective:** Analyze BBI-related data to identify discrepancies and prioritize for clean-up.
   - **Tasks:**
      - Extract BBI-specific data related to trade bookings and entity entitlements.
      - Segment data to identify clients with BBI-related exceptions.

2. **Brexit Reconciliations Team Engagement:**
   - **Objective:** Collaborate with the Brexit Reconciliations Team to leverage their expertise and datasets.
   - **Tasks:**
      - Engage with the Brexit Reconciliations Team to access datasets related to nexus migration status.
      - Request extracts confirming clients' migration status and dual entitlements.

3. **Client Validation and Trade History:**
   - **Objective:** Validate clients' migration status and assess historical trade history for active clients.
   - **Tasks:**
      - Communicate with clients to confirm migration status and dual entitlements.
      - Pull trading history for the most active clients in the USD Corp bond space.

4. **Onboarding System Verification:**
   - **Objective:** Validate and update entity entitlements in the onboarding system based on extracted information.
   - **Tasks:**
      - Cross-verify extracted data with onboarding system records.
      - Update and align entity entitlements based on the validated information.

5. **Documentation and Communication:**
   - **Objective:** Document findings and communicate updates to relevant teams and stakeholders.
   - **Tasks:**
      - Document BBI-related clean-up activities and outcomes.
      - Communicate changes and resolutions to internal teams, including Credit IT.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback Loop:**
   - **Objective:** Establish continuous monitoring mechanisms and feedback loops for ongoing improvements.
   - **Tasks:**
      - Implement regular checks to ensure the sustained effectiveness of clean-up measures.
      - Encourage feedback from the Brexit Reconciliations Team for continuous improvement.

7. **Documentation and Process Improvement:**
   - **Objective:** Document the BBI portion of the clean-up for reference and future enhancements.
   - **Tasks:**
      - Document specific activities related to the BBI clean-up.
      - Identify and propose process improvements for enhanced efficiency.

By integrating the BBI-specific tasks into the overall clean-up initiative, you can ensure a holistic and coordinated approach to resolving booking issues, validating client information, and enhancing operational efficiency on both the credit side and BBI-related aspects of the project. This comprehensive strategy will contribute to the success of the entire initiative.
