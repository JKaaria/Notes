Certainly! Let's summarize the entirety of this project:

**Objective:**
Improve the matching rate of trades post-execution in the fixed income middle office of an investment bank.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- Alteryx for data preparation and pre-processing.
- Bloomberg Terminal with Excel Add-In for accessing financial data.
- Excel VBA for automation and macro execution.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Preparation with Alteryx:**
   - Alteryx workflow is designed to read SWIFT report data.
   - Unique status codes in the "STATUS_REASON" column are identified using the "Unique" tool.
   - Filter tool is used to separate data for each unique status code.
   - Export tools are used to save filtered data into separate CSV files for each status code.
   - All CSV files are stored in a shared filepath accessible by the Bloomberg-enabled machine.

2. **Bloomberg-Enabled Machine Workflow:**
   - A set of Excel macros is developed on the Bloomberg-enabled machine to:
     - Loop through each CSV file in the shared filepath.
     - Query Bloomberg Terminal using the Bloomberg Excel Add-In for trade details.
     - Generate results and identify mismatches drivers.
     - Create emails to trade support teams based on the results.

3. **Communication and Reporting:**
   - Emails generated from the Bloomberg-enabled machine provide information to trade support teams.
   - Results indicate whether the client needs to match the trade or trade support needs to amend and match the client.

**Automation:**
   - Alteryx workflow is scheduled to run at specified intervals to handle new trade data.
   - Bloomberg-enabled machine runs Excel macros automatically or as scheduled to perform API calls to Bloomberg Terminal and generate emails.

**Benefits:**
   - Automation reduces manual efforts and improves efficiency.
   - Swift identification of trade mismatches and prompt communication to trade support teams.
   - Utilizes Alteryx for data preparation and Bloomberg Terminal with Excel Add-In for financial data access.

**Considerations:**
   - Ensure secure data transfer between Alteryx and the Bloomberg-enabled machine.
   - Regularly update and maintain the Alteryx workflow and Excel macros as needed.
   - Monitor and refine the process for continuous improvement.

By combining Alteryx for data processing, Excel VBA for automation, and Bloomberg Terminal for financial data access, this project aims to streamline the trade matching process, reduce errors, and enhance overall efficiency in the fixed income middle office of the investment bank.





BOW:

**Title:**
Enhancing Trade Matching Efficiency in Fixed Income Middle Office

**Problem Statement:**
The current trade matching process in the fixed income middle office of the investment bank relies heavily on manual interventions, client emails reporting mismatches, and manual calculations using Bloomberg Terminal. This leads to inefficiencies, delays, and a higher risk of errors in resolving trade discrepancies.

**Benefits Description:**
- **Automated Data Preparation:** Utilizing Alteryx for automated data preparation ensures accurate and streamlined processing of trade data.
  
- **Efficient Bloomberg Integration:** The Bloomberg-enabled machine runs Excel macros to automate the interaction with Bloomberg Terminal, making API calls for trade details, and generating emails for prompt communication to trade support teams.

- **Reduced Manual Efforts:** Automation reduces manual efforts involved in identifying and resolving trade mismatches, improving overall efficiency.

- **Prompt Communication:** Automatic generation of emails provides timely notifications to trade support teams, allowing for quick resolution of discrepancies.

**Impact if Not Done:**
- **Increased Operational Risks:** Without automation, the reliance on manual processes increases the risk of operational errors, potentially leading to financial losses.

- **Delayed Trade Resolutions:** Manual handling of trade mismatches and communication via emails may result in delays, impacting the timely resolution of trades.

- **Client Satisfaction Issues:** Slow response times and potential errors in trade resolution may lead to dissatisfaction among clients, affecting relationships.

- **Inefficient Resource Utilization:** Manual processes are resource-intensive and may result in inefficient use of workforce, impacting productivity.

By implementing this project, the investment bank aims to mitigate these challenges, streamline trade matching, and enhance overall operational efficiency in the fixed income middle office.
