Hi Paul and Steve,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to explore potential collaboration opportunities between the Middle Office (MO) and the Trading Desk.

- **Background:** With 8 years of experience as a Python/VBA developer in FICC MO, I'm actively seeking projects to enhance my work experience portfolio.

- **Skillset:** Proficient in Python and VBA, as demonstrated in my public portfolio: [GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/JKaaria?tab=repositories).

- **Interest in Projects:** Eager to contribute my skills to projects aligned with the trading and risk functions. If there are ongoing initiatives where my expertise could be valuable, I'm ready to get involved.

- **FO Collaboration:** Open to sharing and discussing potential collaborations with Front Office (FO) contacts if there's interest.

I appreciate your time and consideration. Looking forward to the possibility of working together and contributing to the success of our team.

Best regards,

[Your Name] FICC Middle Office Python/VBA Developer
