Subject: Response to Proposed Discussion

Dear [Manager's Name],

Thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to address the concerns I have raised. However, I feel it is important to clarify that I have continually attempted to engage in resolution discussions with Bill throughout my time working here. Unfortunately, these conversations often ended with me being strong-armed into compromising positions, preventing my concerns from being escalated beyond Bill.

For instance:
- My request to withdraw from the promotion was never communicated to you or Andrew. Instead, Bill pressured me into accepting it.
- My repeated attempts to express dissatisfaction with my isolation on the 7th floor were similarly dismissed until the team was forced to find an alternative solution.

One of the key issues is the lack of transparency within our organization. It appears that the lower your rank within the firm, the less your voice is heard, regardless of the validity of your concerns. This culture has made it difficult for me to feel supported or heard.

For these reasons, I am not willing to engage with Bill again. I believe a formal, independent investigation would be the most appropriate next step to ensure that my concerns are addressed fairly and objectively.

Thank you for your understanding.

Kind regards,
Jeremy
