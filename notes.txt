Subject: Inquiry Regarding Enrichment of Client Contacts Spreadsheet with Legal Entity SDS

Hi Scott,

I hope this email finds you well. 

We are currently working on enhancing our client contacts spreadsheet, which serves as a crucial reference for various controls and scripts within our system. As part of this initiative, we are aiming to enrich the spreadsheet with the corresponding Legal Entity SDS for each client name.

Given the importance of this enhancement to our processes, we were wondering if it would be possible to extract the Legal Entity SDS from the SDS system for the approximately 1390 client records we have in our spreadsheet.

We believe that incorporating this information would significantly contribute to the accuracy and completeness of our data, thereby improving the effectiveness of our controls and scripts.

If there are any specific procedures, requirements, or timelines we need to follow for this request, please let us know. Additionally, if there are any potential challenges or considerations we should be aware of, we would appreciate your insights.

Thank you for your time and assistance with this matter. We look forward to your guidance on how we can proceed with this data enrichment.

Best regards,
