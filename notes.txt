Subject: Explanation of New Automated Counterparty ID Reconciliation Logic

Hi Noel and Dan,

I wanted to provide a quick walkthrough of the logic behind our new automated Counterparty ID reconciliation process. This is to keep you in the loop and ensure clarity on the process.

**Logic Overview:**
- **If EB Sales Book to (xxxx) Book:**
  - Against (xxxx) SDS.
  - The Counterparty will need to book to (xxxx) SDS.

This logic ensures alignment in our trade data, creating a more streamlined and error-free process. I've personally coded and implemented this automation, currently in the testing phase.

**Your Role:**
- No action needed from your end.
- Simply hold on to the attached Logic Table for future reference.

Your insights are always valuable as we enhance our processes. Let me know if you have any questions or if further clarification is needed.

Best,
[Your Name]
