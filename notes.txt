Summary:

Project: Cleaning up client account numbers (SDS mappings) in databases created by salespeople in Fixed Income (Bond) Trading operations.
Progress: Significant progress made in identifying and rectifying incorrect, null, or potentially problematic SDS mappings.
Scope: Identified around 8,000 SDS mappings across 60 salespeople, with each database containing between 1 and 700 records. In the highest volume database, 147 mappings (around 20%) were incorrect, null, or posed a potential control risk.
Impact: Analysis of trades feeding into new fails reporting system over a two-week period revealed that out of a possible 4,509 trades, 1,728 (just under 40%) returned fail codes for post-trade functions to resolve.
Importance: Highlights the significant impact that incorrect SDS mappings can have on operations and reinforces the importance of cleaning up the data.
