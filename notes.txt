Hi Alex,

I trust this email finds you in good spirits. I hope you don't mind me reaching out based on Nick's recommendation. We're currently working on estimating cost savings and enhancing efficiency in our trade processes.

Objective:
- Estimate cost saved by reducing failed trades
- Provide insights for continuous process improvement

Timeline:
- Regular extraction (monthly/weekly)

Your expertise in Celonis is noted, and we believe your insights could significantly contribute to our goals. Any thoughts or guidance you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if there are specific contacts or resources you recommend, we'd be keen to explore those as well.

Looking forward to the possibility of collaboration.

Kind Regards,
Jeremy Kaaria
