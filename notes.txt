Subject: Analysis of Failing Settlement Trade Themes in EUR SSA Market

Hi Paul,

I hope this message finds you well. As requested, I've conducted an analysis of failing settlement trade themes in the EUR SSA market, and I wanted to share the key findings with you.

Across various distribution desks, we observed a consistent trend in the mean failed settlement route cause. The primary driver appears to be inventory delays within our own house accounts, coupled with a shortage of inventory in the short term.

Additionally, there is a notable pattern where trades are dispatched to the market before the value date (VD), receiving swift settlement acknowledgments ('ACK'), but the actual cash/securities settlement occurs between VD+1 and VD+3.

To address these issues, I recommend investigating the inventory delays with our relationship manager (RM) at Euroclear. This could provide valuable insights and potential solutions to improve the settlement process.

Please let me know if you would like further details or if there's anything specific you'd like to focus on in our follow-up actions.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
