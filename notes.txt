Certainly! Here's a simplified explanation of each part:

**Sub One:**
This script does the following:
1. Sets the source folder path and file name pattern.
2. Searches for a file matching the specified pattern in the source folder.
3. If found, it opens the file, copies data from its first sheet, and pastes it into a target sheet named "TradeData" in the current workbook.
4. If the target sheet doesn't exist, it creates one.

**Sub Two:**
This script focuses on the "TradeData" sheet:
1. Finds the column number of the header "Issuer Abbrev."
2. Identifies the last row in the sheet.
3. Loops through each row in the "Issuer Abbrev" column, deleting rows where the value doesn't start with "US Treasury WI."

**Sub Three:**
This script further processes the "TradeData" sheet:
1. Finds column numbers for headers "Issuer Abbrev" and "Quantity."
2. Identifies the last row in the sheet.
3. Creates an Outlook Application.
4. Loops through each row, checking if the "Issuer Abbrev" starts with "US Treasury WI" and the "Quantity" is at least 100 million.
5. Generates an HTML-formatted email body with trade details for qualifying rows.
6. Creates an Outlook email with the generated body, subject, and recipient, and displays it.
7. Releases the Outlook mail and application objects after processing.

In summary, these scripts automate the extraction, filtering, and notification of specific trade data from a source file, making it easier for stakeholders to manage and analyze relevant information.
