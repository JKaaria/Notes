### Project Summary:

#### **Objective:**
Implement a streamlined Alteryx workflow to enhance fails analysis and net position calculation for the Fixed Income (FI) Cash desk. The primary focus is on validating inventory root cause breaks through position and internal transfer reconciliations.

#### **Data Sources:**
- **Internal Stock Position Screen Report**
- **Trade Booking System Data**
- **Internal Transfer Records**

#### **Workflow Steps:**

### 1. Data Input:

Connect to relevant data sources using Alteryx's Input Data tool.

### 3. Net Position Calculation:

#### 3.1 Net Position Metrics:

- Aggregate data using the Summarize tool to calculate net positions based on security, position, and timestamp.
- Identify net long and short positions.

#### 3.2 Enrichment with Fails Reports:

- Join fails reports data to the net position calculations using the Join tool.
- Enhance net position insights with details about failed trades.

### 4. Internal Transfer Reconciliations:

#### 4.1 Data Input:

- Bring in internal transfer records using the Input Data tool.

#### 4.2 Reconciliation Process:

- Reconcile internal transfers with net position data using the Join or Union tool.
- Resolve discrepancies to ensure accurate net position information.

### 5. Output and Reporting:

- Use the Output Data tool to save results in a preferred format.
- Generate reports or dashboards for visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI.

### 6. Iteration and Feedback:

- Establish a feedback loop to continuously improve the workflow based on stakeholder insights.

### 7. Documentation:

- Document the workflow, including data sources, calculations, and reconciliation processes, with annotations for better understanding.

#### **Benefits:**
- Improved fails analysis and root cause identification.
- Enhanced accuracy in net position calculations.
- Streamlined reconciliation processes leading to more informed decision-making.

#### **Business Problem Addressed:**
Inefficient fails analysis and net position calculations leading to challenges in identifying root causes, resulting in potential liquidity gaps and operational inefficiencies.

### Title:
**Optimizing Fails Analysis and Net Position Calculation Workflow for FI Cash Desk**

### Problem Statement:
The current fails analysis and net position calculation processes in the FI Cash desk lack efficiency and accuracy, leading to challenges in identifying root causes of failed trades and maintaining a clear view of net positions. This inefficiency poses a risk to liquidity management and operational effectiveness.

### Benefits Description:
1. **Enhanced Fails Analysis:**
   - Improved identification of root causes through enriched net position calculations.
   - Streamlined reconciliation processes for fails reports, providing a comprehensive fails analysis.

2. **Accurate Net Position Calculation:**
   - Net position metrics development for a precise view of long and short positions.
   - Enrichment with fails reports data for a more accurate representation of net positions affected by failed trades.

3. **Streamlined Internal Transfer Reconciliations:**
   - Integration of internal transfer records to reconcile with net positions.
   - Resolution of discrepancies to ensure the accuracy of net position information.

4. **Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Integration of supplementary net position calculations with real-time monitoring data.
   - Implementation of alert systems for key events, ensuring timely responses.

### Impact if Not Done:
1. **Operational Inefficiency:**
   - Continued challenges in fails analysis and net position calculations, impacting operational efficiency.
   - Difficulty in identifying and addressing root causes, leading to persistent liquidity gaps.

2. **Risk to Decision-Making:**
   - Lack of accurate net position data affecting decision-making processes.
   - Inability to respond promptly to failed trades and market events, posing a risk to effective decision-making.

3. **Reduced Collaboration:**
   - Hindered collaboration between FI Cash and FI Repo desks due to incomplete and inaccurate net position information.
   - Increased likelihood of coordination challenges in addressing failed trades and managing liquidity.
