What was the issue?
Incorrect, null, or potentially problematic SDS mappings in databases created by salespeople in Fixed Income (Bond) Trading operations.
Identified around 8,000 SDS mappings across 60 salespeople, with each database containing between 1 and 700 records. In the highest volume database, 147 mappings (around 20%) were incorrect, null, or posed a potential control risk.
What is the impact?
Analysis of trades feeding into new fails reporting system over a two-week period revealed that out of a possible 4,509 trades, 1,728 (just under 40%) returned fail codes for post-trade functions to resolve.
Incorrect SDS mappings can have a significant impact on operations.
How are we looking to solve it?
Cleaning up client account numbers (SDS mappings) in the databases created by salespeople in Fixed Income (Bond) Trading operations.
Significant progress made in identifying and rectifying incorrect, null, or potentially problematic SDS mappings.
What will be the desired clean-up outcome and what impact will that have moving forward?
The desired clean-up outcome is to rectify all incorrect, null, or potentially problematic SDS mappings.
This will reduce the number of fail codes returned for post-trade functions to resolve, leading to more efficient operations and reducing the risk of control issues.
