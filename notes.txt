Subject: Action Needed: Extracting Data for Impact Assessment

Hey Nick,

Hope you're doing well. Quick askâ€”I need your expertise to extract data on total trade touch points from our Front and Back Office systems in order to quantify the est. monthly/weekly cost savings our generated by IBMO.

**Objective:**
- Estimate cost saved by reducing failed trades
- Provide insights for continuous process improvement

**Timeline:**
- Aim for a regular extraction (monthly/weekly)

**Collaboration:**
Any thoughts on how we might go about this / contacts that could help would be greatly appreciated.
