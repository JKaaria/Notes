Subject: Explanation of Delayed Settlement and VD-1 Failing Delivery

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. We would like to provide a clear explanation regarding the delayed settlement and the VD-1 failing delivery issue you may have encountered recently. 

The delayed settlement is due to a grace period granted to bond issuers, allowing them to meet legal, regulatory, and offering document requirements. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a live VD-1 failing delivery.

Here are the key points:

1. **Delayed Settlement**: Bond issuers are granted grace periods for proper compliance and alignment with offering documents.

2. **VD-1 Failing Delivery**: This issue is a direct outcome of the delayed settlement, and we apologize for any inconvenience.

3. **Resolution**: We are actively resolving the situation and ensuring compliance with the offering documents.

4. **Commitment to You**: We remain committed to fulfilling our obligations and minimizing any disruption to your operations.

5. **Open Communication**: We value your partnership and are available for any questions or updates.

Your satisfaction is our priority, and we will keep you informed of progress. If you have any concerns, please contact your dedicated relationship manager or our client services team.

We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Investment Bank]
