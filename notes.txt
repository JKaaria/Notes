Subject: Proposal for Improved Rates Risk Management: Centralized Coverage Group

Dear [Rates Business Manager's Name],

I'm writing to propose an enhancement that will significantly improve our rates risk management in Fixed Income Operations.

Currently, blotters are managed based on individual coverage lists, causing control gaps and discrepancies. To address this, I suggest implementing a centralized coverage group approach. Each operations user would have a standardized "golden source" coverage group for their blotters.

Benefits:

1. **Enhanced Control:** Consistent coverage across blotters reduces discrepancies and control risks.

2. **Efficiency:** Standardized approach streamlines processes, reducing errors and manual adjustments.

3. **Scalability:** Easily onboard new users and adapt to changes.

4. **Better Risk Management:** Consistent coverage leads to more accurate risk assessments.

I kindly seek your approval to proceed. The application support team is ready to implement this framework.

Your support will drive positive operational changes. For more details, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
