Subject: Request for Alteryx Permission - Enhancing Data Processes

Dear Shankar,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Jeremy Kaaria, currently spearheading critical projects in the middle office at Barclays Capital, where we are navigating diverse native Excel environments. I am writing to propose the integration of Alteryx into our toolkit, leveraging my expertise in cloud computing principles and data analytics. This strategic move aims to fortify our ETL lifecycle, ensuring a more robust approach to our current projects.

Here's why this initiative is crucial:

- **Experience**: Eight years in the financial industry, providing pivotal support globally.

- **Skills**: Certified in cloud computing principles, data analysis, and adept with ETL software like Amazon Glue/Snowflake.

- **Current Projects**: Leading multiple initiatives, including data reconciliation, entity auto-reconciliation, and optimizing workflows for the macro trading floor.

- **Efficiency Boost**: Alteryx promises to streamline processes, amplify data analytics, and enhance reporting capabilities across all ongoing projects.

I seek your permission to explore Alteryx integration further, aligning with our commitment to efficiency and excellence. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the potential benefits at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Jeremy Kaaria
