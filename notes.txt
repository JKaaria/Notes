Subject: Important: Update on SDS Mappings and Remedial Action

Dear Front Office Stakeholders,

I wanted to provide you with an important update regarding the recent exercise we conducted to clean up the SDS mappings in our databases. Please take a moment to review the key points below:

- The exercise aimed to rectify incorrect, null, or potentially problematic SDS mappings.
- Results showed a significant number of mappings (around 20%) were incorrect, null, or posed potential control risks.
- Bad SDS mappings increase the risk of trades bypassing essential IBMO controls for confirmation, settlement, and post-settlement processes.
- The associated risks include control issues, potential financial losses, and compliance concerns.
- Remedial action will involve the immediate removal of all null mappings to improve data integrity and reduce trade processing errors.

Moving forward, we kindly request your cooperation in ensuring the accuracy of SDS mappings for the trades you manage. Should you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the IBMO team or use the generic pending key for further clarification or validation.

By collectively addressing these issues, we can enhance operational efficiency, minimize risks, and provide a higher level of service to our clients.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we appreciate your cooperation in this important endeavor.

Best regards,
