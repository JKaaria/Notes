   - Overlay live FISS data onto Delphi data to exclude settled trades.

2. **Steps:**
   - Open respective files.
   - Copy relevant data to Delphi sheet.
   - Close the files.

### Sub Three
1. **Purpose:**
   - Perform VLOOKUP to identify LDN region trades/current open trades as Delphi data is delayed by 1d.

2. **Steps:**
   - Copy specific VLOOKUP formulas from one sheet to another.

### Sub Four
1. **Purpose:**
   - Prepare data for a pivot.

2. **Steps:**

   - Utilize the dashboard for risk consolidations.

2. **Steps:**
   - Monitor market consolidation/spikes (e.g. CMIS in French DOM).

### Summary
Leverage the dashboard to identify and address risk consolidations, allowing for a targeted and efficient automated email process.


### Sub EmailWithTableAndHeaders
1. **Purpose:**
