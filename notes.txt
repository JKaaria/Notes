As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, MarketAxess Match is a trading protocol provided by MarketAxess Holdings Inc., a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities. MarketAxess Match is designed to facilitate anonymous, all-to-all trading in the credit market, bringing together various market participants such as asset managers, hedge funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors.

The MarketAxess Match platform allows participants to trade corporate bonds directly with each other, bypassing the traditional dealer-to-client model. It aims to improve liquidity and efficiency in the credit market by increasing access to a broader pool of potential counterparties.

MarketAxess Match operates on a request-for-quote (RFQ) model, where participants can request quotes for a specific bond and negotiate prices and quantities with other participants. The platform provides a central order book where participants can view and interact with the liquidity available in the system.

MO Impact

MarketAxess Match can have several impacts on fixed income middle office teams, which are responsible for various operational and administrative functions in the trading lifecycle. Here are a few ways MarketAxess Match may impact fixed income middle office teams:

1. Trade Confirmation and Settlement: MarketAxess Match streamlines the trading process by providing a centralized platform for trade execution. This can enhance efficiency in trade confirmation and settlement processes for middle office teams. By reducing manual processes and improving straight-through processing (STP), the platform can help middle office teams process trades more quickly and accurately.

2. Post-Trade Processing: Middle office teams typically handle post-trade processing tasks, such as trade enrichment, allocation, and affirmation. With MarketAxess Match, middle office teams may need to adapt their processes to integrate with the platform's post-trade workflows. They may need to reconcile trade details, validate allocations, and ensure accurate affirmation and settlement instructions.

3. Data Management: MarketAxess Match generates a significant amount of trade data. Middle office teams may need to develop or enhance their data management capabilities to effectively capture, analyze, and report on the data generated by trades executed on the platform. This could involve integrating the platform's data with existing systems, implementing data validation and quality checks, and leveraging analytics tools to gain insights from the data.

4. Compliance and Regulatory Reporting: Middle office teams are responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and reporting obligations. With MarketAxess Match, there may be new reporting requirements specific to trades executed on the platform. Middle office teams may need to update their compliance processes and systems to capture and report the necessary data accurately.

5. Relationship Management: Middle office teams often liaise with various stakeholders, including trading desks, compliance teams, and external parties. MarketAxess Match may require middle office teams to establish new relationships with platform users and interact with them for trade-related inquiries, issue resolution, and general support.
