# User Guide for Trade Data Transformation and Email Notification

## Introduction

This user guide provides instructions on how to use the Trade Data Transformation and Email Notification script. The script is designed to transform trade data, specifically modifying values based on predefined criteria, and send email notifications for mismatching entities.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following:

- Microsoft Excel installed on your machine.
- A workbook with trade data saved in the sheet named "TradeData" (or the actual name of your trade data sheet).
- Additional sheets named "LogicTable" and "ResultSheet" for specific operations.

## Script Overview

The script consists of six main subroutines:

1. **Sub One**
   - Modifies values in the "Settle Legal Entity" column based on predefined criteria.

2. **Sub Two**
   - Deletes rows from the "TradeData" sheet where the value in column AW does not start with "US912."

3. **Sub Three**
   - Renames the header "Counterparty ID" to "SDS" in the "TradeData" sheet.

4. **Sub Four**
   - Renames the header "Settle Legal Entity" to "Entity" in the "TradeData" sheet.

5. **Sub Five**
   - Compares data between the "TradeData" and "LogicTable" sheets and populates the "ResultSheet" with relevant information.

6. **Sub Six**
   - Sends an email notification for mismatching entities to specified recipients using Microsoft Outlook.

## Running the Script

1. **Open Workbook:**
   - Open the workbook containing the trade data and the script.

2. **Enable Macros:**
   - Ensure that macros are enabled in Excel.

3. **Run Sub One to Sub Six:**
   - Press `Alt + F8`, select the desired subroutine (One to Six), and click `Run` to execute the specific operation.

## Important Notes

- **Sheet Names:**
  - If your sheets have different names, adjust the sheet names in the script accordingly.

- **Specific Criteria:**
  - Review each subroutine's criteria and modify them as needed.

- **Recipient Email:**
  - In Sub Six, replace the email addresses in the recipients' section with the actual recipient email addresses.

- **Outlook Access:**
  - Ensure you have access to Microsoft Outlook for sending emails.

- **Modify Email Subject:**
  - You can modify the subject of the email in Sub Six if needed.
