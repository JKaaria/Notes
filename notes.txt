To achieve the outlined objectives of building a fail root cause view, developing real-time monitoring and alerts, creating a supplementary net position calculation, and influencing FI Cash/FI Repo collaborative workflow, you can structure your data integration and analysis approach as follows:

### 1. Building Fail Root Cause View:

**Data Sets:**
- External Vendor Pre-Matching Data
- SWIFT Pre-Matching Reports
- Internal Stock Position Screen Report
- Fails Management System Data
- Trade Booking System Data
- Lifecycle Exception Management System Data

**Integration Approach:**
1. **Common Identifier:** Identify a common unique identifier (e.g., trade ID) across datasets to link related information.
2. **Data Alignment:** Align External Vendor Pre-Matching Data, SWIFT Pre-Matching Reports, Internal Stock Position Screen Report, Fails Management System Data, Trade Booking System Data, and Lifecycle Exception Management System Data based on the common identifier.
3. **Root Cause Indicators:** Incorporate indicators from SWIFT pre-matching, internal stock positions, fails reports, and exception management data to identify root causes of fails.
4. **Lifecycle States:** Track and visualize the lifecycle states of each trade from front to back using data from trade booking systems and exception management systems.
5. **Reporting:** Generate reports or dashboards that provide a comprehensive view of fails, their root causes, and associated lifecycle states.

### 2. Developing Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts:

**Data Sets:**
- External Vendor Pre-Matching Data
- SWIFT Pre-Matching Reports
- Internal Stock Position Screen Report
- Fails Management System Data
- Trade Booking System Data
- Lifecycle Exception Management System Data
- Settlement System Data

**Integration Approach:**
1. **Real-Time Integration:** Implement real-time integration of data from External Vendor Pre-Matching, SWIFT pre-matching, internal stock positions, fails reports, trade bookings, lifecycle exceptions, and settlement systems.
2. **Alert Criteria:** Define alert criteria based on discrepancies, exceptions, or patterns observed in the integrated data.
3. **Automated Alerts:** Set up automated alert mechanisms triggered by real-time data changes, such as failed trades, inventory discrepancies, or exceptions.
4. **Thresholds:** Establish thresholds for critical events, prompting immediate alerts for timely intervention.
5. **Visualization:** Create visualizations or dashboards that provide an overview of real-time monitoring and alerts.

### 3. Supplementary Net Position Calculation:

**Data Sets:**
- Internal Stock Position Screen Report
- Trade Booking System Data

**Integration Approach:**
1. **Net Position Metrics:** Develop net position metrics by aggregating and reconciling data from internal stock positions and trade booking systems.
2. **Enrichment:** Enrich net position calculations with data from fails reports, providing insights into net long/short positions affected by failed trades.
3. **Integration with Real-Time Data:** Integrate supplementary net position calculations with real-time monitoring data for a comprehensive view.

### 4. Influencing FI Cash/FI Repo Collaborative Workflow:

**Data Sets:**
- External Vendor Pre-Matching Data
- Internal Stock Position Screen Report
- Fails Management System Data
- Trade Booking System Data
- Lifecycle Exception Management System Data

**Integration Approach:**
1. **Collaboration Indicators:** Identify collaboration indicators within the integrated data, such as fails that impact both FI Cash and FI Repo positions.
2. **Workflow Insights:** Analyze workflow data to understand inefficiencies or challenges in the collaboration between FI Cash and FI Repo desks.
3. **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop involving stakeholders to provide insights into collaboration improvements.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Continuously refine the collaborative workflow based on data-driven insights and feedback.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Data Cleaning and Validation:** Implement robust data cleaning and validation processes to ensure accuracy and consistency across integrated datasets.
- **Scalability:** Design the integration processes to be scalable to handle increasing data volumes over time.
- **Compliance:** Ensure that the integrated data and workflows comply with regulatory requirements and risk management considerations.

By following this structured approach, you can leverage the diverse datasets to achieve your objectives, providing a comprehensive view of fails, real-time monitoring, supplementary net position calculations, and insights to enhance collaboration between FI Cash and FI Repo desks.
