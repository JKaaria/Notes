Subject: Inquiry Regarding Implementation of UST Reconciliation Project on US Dollar Credit (Corporate Bond) Side

Hi Brian,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the UST Reconciliation project we recently completed. The project was initiated to address concerns related to TRACE regulatory violations, operational risks associated with DTC pre-matching, and the financial impact of settlement failures in UST trades.

Here's a brief overview of the project:

1. **Scope:**
   - UST Reconciliation: Focus on resolving discrepancies and ensuring compliance with TRACE regulations.
   - Operational Risk Mitigation: Address challenges in DTC pre-matching to enhance operational efficiency.
   - Settlement Failures: Minimize financial impact by identifying and resolving issues leading to failures.

2. **Steps Undertaken:**
   - Comprehensive Analysis: Conducted a thorough analysis of UST trades, identifying discrepancies and potential risk areas.
   - Process Optimization: Streamlined processes related to DTC pre-matching to improve efficiency and reduce operational risks.
   - Regulatory Compliance: Ensured adherence to TRACE regulations through enhanced reconciliation measures.
   - Client-Specific Approach: Tailored solutions to address client-specific needs and concerns.

3. **Outcomes:**
   - Improved Reconciliation: Resolved discrepancies in UST trades, enhancing overall reconciliation processes.
   - Operational Efficiency: Optimized DTC pre-matching processes, reducing operational risks and improving settlement success rates.
   - Compliance Confidence: Enhanced TRACE regulatory compliance to mitigate the risk of violations.

Given the success of the UST Reconciliation project, we have been approached to implement a similar initiative on the US Dollar Credit (Corporate Bond) side. To proceed effectively, we would appreciate your insights into the different types of wash logic applied on the credit side. Specifically, we are interested in understanding whether these logics are applied at a client-by-client level or if there are other determining factors.

Your expertise in this matter would greatly contribute to the success of the upcoming project. Looking forward to your guidance.
