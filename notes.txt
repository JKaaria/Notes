Subject: Reinitiating Knowledge Sharing Sessions: Bridging the FO/MO Gap

Hi Tarun,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to revisit the idea of knowledge-sharing sessions, particularly considering the evolving landscape in both the Front Office (FO) and Middle Office (MO).

- **Past Success:** Having attended a knowledge share session years ago, I found it immensely beneficial in gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges and priorities within the FO.

- **Current Relevance:** Given the recent developments in our approach to long-term unmatched trades, there is a heightened need for seamless collaboration between FO and MO.

- **Alignment for Comprehensive Approach:** The aim is to bridge the gap between FO and MO priorities, ensuring a more comprehensive and aligned approach to risk management.

I believe reinitiating these sessions could be highly advantageous. Your insights and perspective from the FO would be invaluable in shaping a program that truly addresses the needs of both teams.

Looking forward to your thoughts and the possibility of reigniting this collaborative initiative.

Best regards,

[Your Name] Business Analyst, FICC Middle Office
