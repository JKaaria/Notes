Subject: Apologies for the Delay - On-Site Training Confirmation

Dear [Market Axess Match Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to your requests regarding the on-site training session. Due to unforeseen circumstances and competing priorities within our department, we regrettably experienced some delays in finalizing the necessary arrangements.

However, I am pleased to inform you that we have now engaged the relevant stakeholders and obtained the necessary permissions to proceed with the on-site training. The enthusiasm and interest from our team have been high, and we are eager to explore the capabilities of the Market Axess Match system.

To ensure a seamless and effective training experience, we kindly request your assistance in scheduling a suitable date and time for the session. Our preferred timeline for the training is within the next two to three weeks. Please let us know your availability, and we will do our best to accommodate your schedule.

Furthermore, it would be greatly appreciated if you could provide us with a detailed agenda for the training session. This will allow us to adequately prepare and ensure that the training covers all relevant aspects of the system that are applicable to our fixed income middle office operations.

We are excited about the potential of the Market Axess Match system and its ability to enhance our operational efficiency and trading capabilities. Your expertise and guidance during the training session will be invaluable as we begin incorporating this platform into our daily processes.

Once again, please accept our sincerest apologies for the delay in responding to your requests. We are committed to making the most of our partnership with Market Axess Match and are eager to get started with the on-site training. We look forward to working closely with your team and harnessing the full potential of your system.

Thank you for your understanding and support. We eagerly await your response to proceed with the scheduling and agenda confirmation.
