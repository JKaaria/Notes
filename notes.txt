Subject: Streamlined UST Settlements: Leveraging FED/EC Intermediary SSI

Dear [Client Contact],

I hope this message finds you well.

In light of the World Bank's recent insights on U.S. Treasury (UST) settlements, we are reaching out to explore the possibility of optimizing our processes to enhance efficiency and reduce settlement timeframes.

**Key Highlights from World Bank Documentation:**
When transferring global bonds from a Fed user to a Euroclear (EC) or Cedel user, the documentation suggests a streamlined process involving Morgan or Chase. This approach aims to expedite settlement with minimal credit exposure.

**Questions for Your Consideration:**
1. **Awareness**: Are you aware of this settlement mechanism?
2. **SSI Availability**: Do you have a Fed/EC intermediary SSI in place?
3. **Readiness**: Are you open to leveraging this streamlined approach for future UST settlements?

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- Expedited settlement within New York business hours
- Potential reduction of credit exposure
- Efficient use of existing procedures

We would greatly appreciate your insights on this matter and your readiness to adopt this approach. If there are any concerns or if you require further clarification, please feel free to reach out.

Your cooperation is pivotal, and we believe this optimization can significantly contribute to smoother UST settlements.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
